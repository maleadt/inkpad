To compile the inkpad application, you need CMake. Once installed, do as following to compile the application:
	1) Make a build directory (can be a subdirectory of the svn trunk)
	   mkdir build
	2) Instruct CMake to generate a Code::Blocks set of makefiles (if the "project" folder is a
	     subdirectory of the checkout, you can just enter "../")
	   cmake "/usr/src/inkpad/trunk"
	3) Build the project
	   make
	4) Run the project
	   ./src/inkpad
